This is an assignment project in a course on desktop applications development.

The idea is to make an Electron application using React for UI and SQLite as a data storage.

For the initial boilerplate seed, this [tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/building-an-electron-application-with-create-react-app-97945861647c) was used.

To get the app running do `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`.

This is work in progress. The project is tracked [here](https://trello.com/b/y01BLiqc/zhurnik)
